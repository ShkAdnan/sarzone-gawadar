                </div>

                <p>

                    It was in 2002-2003 that the then President of Pakistan, General Parvez Musharraf, accorded priority to
                    the

                    development of human and natural resources of Pakistan in general and Balochistan in particular.

                    Accordingly, then Prime Minister, Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali constituted a committee of experts to
                    assess

                    the educational and vocational needs of the Gwader youth in particular and Baloch youth in general.

                </p>

                <p>

                    The committee was focused to carry out situational analysis, work out future requirements of
                    vocational/

                    technical/ higher education, ascertain needs of the area with special reference to Gwadar Deep Seaport
                    and

                    analyse emerging technologies for future needs.

                </p>

                <p>

                    The committee noted expectations of the area and after detailed analysis put forward their views as
                    given

                    below:-

                </p>

                <ol style="padding:30px;">

                    <li>The present level of vocational training, technical and higher education is not compatible, should

                        therefore be enhanced.</li>

                    <li>In order to meet future needs of Gwadar area, emerging technologies be introduced.</li>

                    <li>To enhance opportunities for local employment â€“ need for the skilled local manpower, existing
                        vocational

                        training centre be strengthened.</li>

                    <li>Multiple prompt strategies to be adopted for training of all kinds of local manpower to meet
                        emerging

                        requirements for Gwadar seaport and related industrial / business activitiesin and around Gwadar
                        city.

                    </li>

                </ol>

                <p>

                    The detailed study carried out by the committee amply highlighted the requirement of establishing an

                    institute in Gwadar which should meet its technologically educated manpower shortfalls. This formed the

                    basis of developing Gwadar Institute of Technology. The institute was envisaged to cover emerging

                    technologies in the fields of food preservation and industrial electronics.



                    Thereafter it was agreed by the Federal and Balochistan Provincial Governments that its establishment
                    cost

                    would be borne by the Federal Government and recurring expenditures to be met by the Government of

                    Balochistan. The constructional works started in 2005

                    and got completed in 2012.
